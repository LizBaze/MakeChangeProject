# Make Change Project

### Description
This program accepts user input for a sale total and a payment, then determines the correct change to be given, if any.

### Lessons Learned
- doubles are awful and I hate them forever
- print statements are a useful debugging tool (I knew this conceptually but hadn't tested it often)
- if/elseif/else statements allow for incredible granularity
- Don't overcomplicate. My rough draft had a while loop inside an else statement inside another while loop. The top level while loop and the else statement weren't even necessary for the program to function.
- (math.Round(x * 100.0) / 100.0) is useful, although I don't fully understand what's happening (hopefully that's ok!) (P.S. It was not ok and math.round() didn't cover all use cases. Fun!)
- There's probably a better way to do what I did
